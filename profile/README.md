# Welcome to the DIY Synth MNL GitHub
Check out my blog here: [diysynthmnl.github.io](diysynthmnl.github.io)
- Hi! I design and build open source Eurorack modules!
- I'm currently a one person team and have built synth modules as a hobby since 2019 with no formal education on electronics design. Anyone can design and build synth modules! I'm here to help you!
- I'll be sharing source files of my projects here. Documentation for the builds are also included.
- I try to be as thorough as possible in my design documentation, hopefully these would demistify how the modules work (and possibly give you the ideas to be able to create your own designs).
